  Hint: user data is stored in the userData object above.

// Question 2: Data Handling

  Return -1 if no one is from San Francisco.
  Hint: Use a lambda function as a value
*/

 */

 */

/* San Luis Obispo (SLO) over the age of 40, and return an updated
/* version of them with their position set to staff. If no one meets
/* these criteria, return undefined
